            Your similarity score is {similarity}
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                This score represents the cosine of the angle between the vectors representing the words
                of the two documents. There's not much specific reasoning behind it, it's just that it's 
                easily calculatable as the dot product divided by the product of each of the magnitudes.
            </p>
            <h2>
                For reference though here are some scores that you could get:
            </h2>
            <p>
                The similarity of two documents which no words in commonwill be 0 <br>
                The similarity of two documents which are the same will be 1<br>
                The similarity of my SRP application and History paper on Islamic Empires was 0.60<br>
                The similarity of my SRP application and the article it was based on was 0.71<br>
