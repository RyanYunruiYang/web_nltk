The main file that you'll need to use is run.py

The only two files which participate in the running of code are run.py and nltk_test.py

The libraries necessary are those at the headers of these two docs:

import random
import string
import cherrypy
import os
import nltk
from nltk import sent_tokenize
from nltk import word_tokenize

from nltk.probability import FreqDist
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from wordcloud import WordCloud

import numpy as np
import math
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

from nltk.corpus import wordnet
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer


After downloading these and executing run.py, you will be able to access the website by going to localhost:8080


Note: Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to pass an image through to get the wordcloud to work on all devices, so you will not be able to use that feature unless you place all of this code into a folder called "java2020/cs550".
